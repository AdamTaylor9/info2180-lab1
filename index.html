           <p>
            My name is Adam Ross Taylor. I am 21 years old. I currently go to the University of the West Indies Mona where 
            I am pursuing a Major in Computer Science and a minor in General Physics.
            <br> 
            I am interested in web development as I think being able to design, develop and maintain websites is a good skill 
            to have in the field of Computer Science.
